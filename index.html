        hello my name is liam, this is my first website without help. <br />
        i am unsure what this website will be about; i think i will figure that out as we go.<br />
        first things first, i need a todo list. things i'd like to attempt to do.
    </p>
    <h3>to do</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>add an image</li>
        <li>create a css document</li>
        <li>learn how to make checkboxes</li>
        <li>music?</li>
        <li>different tabs?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>adding an image:</h2>
    <p>
        i would like to add an image into this website. <br />
        what image though?<br/><br/>
        honestly i think this should be like a real creative project.<br/>
        i think i'm going to either:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>create an image</li>
        <li>use a previously created image</li>
    </ul>
    <p>   
        as a placeholder for now i'm going to add a previously created image.<br/>
        now how do i add an image?<br/><br/>
        i created a folder titled 'images'.<br/>
        i then downloaded an image that i created a while ago titled 'stupid bitch'.<br/>
        now to actually add it to the website.<br/><br/>
        so i added the image using img src=<br/>
        this may have added the image to the website, but the image is GIANT and does not fit to the screen.<br/> 
        time to figure out how to change that!<br/><br/>
        so i can see that i can use the style attribute directly in the image command.<br/>
        although i think that now would be a good idea to get started on the css document.<br/>
        that way not everything is in the html document.<br/>
        *note: i have no idea if this is a good idea or not but i guess we will find out.*<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>creating a css document</h2>
    <p>    
        so i successfuly created a stylesheet in a folder titled styles.<br/>
        i then attempted to write a section to adjust my images size.<br/>
        the problem?<br/>
        it does absolutly nothing to my image.<br/>
        now to figure out how to actually change the image size.<br/><br/> 
    </p>
